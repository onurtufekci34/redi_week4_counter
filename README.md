# Redi Timer

A simple countdown timer application built using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.



## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Enter a number in the input field and click the "Start Counting" button.

4. The countdown will begin, and you will see the countdown displayed on the screen.

5. When the countdown reaches 0, the message "Countdown complete!" will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of an HTML file that uses Bootstrap for styling and a JavaScript file to handle the countdown logic. Here's a brief explanation of the key parts of the code:

- **HTML**: The HTML file defines the structure of the page, including a title, a heading, an input field, a button, and an area to display the countdown.

- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript code does the following:
  - Retrieves the elements by their IDs.
  - Adds an event listener to the "Start Counting" button.
  - Reads the user input and saves it in Local Storage.
  - Updates the countdown display and uses `setInterval` to start the countdown.
  - Stops the countdown and displays a completion message when it reaches 0.
  - Handles invalid input and provides user feedback.
